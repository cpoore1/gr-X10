# gr-X10

This GNU Radio out-of-tree module generates X10 on-off keying (OOK) signals that have been tested against a 310 MHz RadioShack Plug'n power outlet switch. The flow graphs will turn the switch on or off if the address and data codes correspond to the target. There is a decoding flow graph to use with the X10 remote control to help determine the proper codes.

This software has been integrated into [FISSURE: The RF Framework](https://github.com/ainfosec/FISSURE).
